    <p><b>My name is Whitney Ebuh</b>. I am nineteen years old. I am a student Of the University of the People(Uop). <br> My favorite food is Fufu and Afang soup. I am a christian. I am from Akwa Ibom state.</p>

    <p><u><b>Still I Rise By Maya Angelou</b></u><br></p>

    <p>You may write me down in history <br>
    With your bitter, twisted lies, <br>
    You may trod me in the very dirt <br>
 But still, like dust, I'll rise. <br></p>

 Does my sassiness upset you? <br>
 Why are you beset with gloom? <br>
 ’Cause I walk like I've got oil wells <br>
 Pumping in my living room. <br></p>

 Just like moons and like suns, <br>
 With the certainty of tides, <br>
 Just like hopes springing high, <br>
 Still I'll rise. <br></p>

 Did you want to see me broken? <br>
 Bowed head and lowered eyes? <br>
 Shoulders falling down like teardrops, <br>
 Weakened by my soulful cries? <br></p>

 Does my haughtiness offend you? <br>
 Don't you take it awful hard <br>
 ’Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines <br>
 Diggin’ in my own backyard. <br></p>

 You may shoot me with your words, <br>
 You may cut me with your eyes, <br>
 You may kill me with your hatefulness, <br>
 But still, like air, I’ll rise. <br></p>

 Does my sexiness upset you? <br>
 Does it come as a surprise <br>
 That I dance like I've got diamonds <br>
 At the meeting of my thighs? <br></p>

 Out of the huts of history’s shame <br>
 I rise <br>
 Up from a past that’s rooted in pain <br>
 I rise <br>
 I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide, <br>
 Welling and swelling I bear in the tide. <br></p>

 Leaving behind nights of terror and fear <br>
 I rise <br>
 Into a daybreak that’s wondrously clear <br>
 I rise <br>
 Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave, <br>
 I am the dream and the hope of the slave. <br>
 I rise <br>
 I rise <br>
 I rise. <br></p>
